= Ajaxlinks

Convert conventional links to ajaxs ones.
 
  use example:

     $('#container').ajaxlinks()                          // all the anchors under #container will be converted
     $('#container').ajaxlinks({anchor:'css filter'})     // all the anchors under #container and with that css filter
     $('#container').ajaxlinks({spinner:'#spinner')       // element to show/hide when start/stop the ajax call
     $('#container').ajaxlinks({authToken:'asdfasdf')     // Rails feature... send a token to mitigate XSS
 


And for the same price a ajaxlinks for will-paginate
  
  example:

     $('#container).wpaginate                             // unobstructive javascript links
     $('#container).wpaginate({spinner:'#spinner'})       // use a spinner when change pages
